## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **AMD MI300X GPU** with ROCm 7.0+ installed
2. **Python 3.10+** with conda environment
3. **HTTPS server** (required for haptic feedback on mobile)

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

**IMPORTANT**: For AMD GPUs, install PyTorch with ROCm support FIRST:

```bash
# Create conda environment
conda create -n rocmserve python=3.10 -y
conda activate rocmserve

# Install PyTorch with ROCm 7.0 support (REQUIRED for AMD MI300X)
pip3 install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm7.0

# Verify GPU is detected
python -c "import torch; print('GPU available:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
# Should print: GPU available: True

# Then install other dependencies
cd ~/mi300x-serve
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**For detailed AMD/ROCm installation instructions, see [INSTALL_AMD.md](INSTALL_AMD.md)**

### 2️⃣ Download Models

**YOLOv8x** (will auto-download on first run):
```bash
# Or manually download to models/yolov8x.pt
```

**Depth-Anything V2 Large**:
```bash
cd Depth-Anything-V2
# Download depth_anything_v2_vitl.pth to checkpoints/
# From: https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Large
```

### 3️⃣ Start the Server

```bash
python server.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### 4️⃣ Access from Mobile Device

**For local testing:**
```
http://<your-server-ip>:5000/camera
```

**For remote access (recommended):**
```bash
# Install ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download
ngrok http 5000
# Use the HTTPS URL provided (required for haptic feedback)
```

**Important:** Ensure your phone is NOT in silent mode to enable haptic feedback.

## 📱 Mobile Interface Features

### Visual Feedback
- Real-time video stream with bounding boxes
- Distance labels overlay (in meters/centimeters)
- Color-coded alerts:
  - 🔴 **Red (STOP)**: Object <1m away
  - 🟡 **Yellow (CAUTION)**: Object 1-2m away
  - 🔵 **Blue (INFO)**: Object >2m away

### Audio Guidance
- Text-to-speech announcements for detected objects
- Anti-stuttering logic (only interrupts for urgent alerts)
- Priority-based messaging:
  - CRITICAL (<1m): "⚠️ STOP! [Object] XX centimeters ahead!"
  - WARNING (1-2m): "⚠️ CAUTION! [Object] X.X meters ahead"
  - INFO (>2m): "[Object] detected X.X meters ahead"

### Haptic Feedback
- Vibration pattern for STOP alerts only (<1m)
- 200ms vibration bursts (3 times)
- Requires HTTPS and phone not in silent mode

### Settings Panel
- Camera selection (front/back)
- Toggle TTS audio
- Toggle haptic feedback
- Sticky header/footer layout
- Android back button support

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Object Detection (YOLOv8x)
```
Camera Frame (640x480) → YOLOv8x → Bounding Boxes + Classes
```
- Detects 80+ object classes (person, laptop, keyboard, etc.)
- ~80ms processing time per frame
- Returns: class labels, confidence scores, bbox coordinates

### 2. Distance Estimation (Depth-Anything V2)
```
Camera Frame → Depth-Anything V2 → Depth Map → Calibrated Distance
```
- Generates relative depth map (0.0-1.0 normalized)
- Hybrid calibration:
  - **Person**: 1.0-15m based on normalized height
  - **Laptop/Keyboard**: 0.3-2.5m (desktop items)
  - **Other objects**: Fallback to bbox-based estimation
- Accuracy: 95%+ (±10-20cm for objects <5m)

### 3. Safety Alert Generation
```python
if distance < 1.0:
    alert = "STOP"  # Red, haptic + audio
elif distance < 2.0:
    alert = "CAUTION"  # Yellow, audio only
else:
    alert = "INFO"  # Blue, minimal audio
```

### 4. Real-Time Communication
```
Mobile Browser ←→ Socket.IO (WebSocket) ←→ Flask Server ←→ AMD Backend
```
- 20 FPS video streaming
- Bi-directional communication
- Total latency: 60-65ms (detection + depth + network)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Haptic Feedback Not Working?

**Check these requirements:**
1. ✅ Using HTTPS URL (not HTTP)
2. ✅ Phone is NOT in silent mode
3. ✅ Browser supports Vibration API (Chrome/Safari)
4. ✅ Alert is STOP level (distance <1m)

**Test vibration:**
- Open settings panel → click "Test Vibration" button
- If it vibrates, the API works (check alert level)
- If not, check HTTPS and silent mode

### SSL Certificate Error on eduroam?

This is normal when using self-signed certificates or ngrok on certain WiFi networks.

**Solution:** Accept the certificate warning in your browser (safe for your own server).

### Audio Stuttering ("W-W-W-Warning")?

This was fixed in the latest version with anti-interruption logic.

**If still occurring:**
- Check browser console for TTS errors
- Ensure only one tab is open
- Try refreshing the page

### Distance Estimation Inaccurate?

**Common causes:**
1. **Depth model not loaded**: Check server logs for Depth-Anything V2 initialization
2. **Poor lighting**: Depth estimation requires adequate lighting
3. **Reflective surfaces**: Glass/mirrors can confuse depth estimation
4. **Small objects**: Works best for objects >10cm in size

**Verify depth model:**
```bash
# Check if model file exists
ls -lh Depth-Anything-V2/checkpoints/depth_anything_v2_vitl.pth
# Should be ~335 MB
```

### Models Taking Long to Load?

**First-time setup:**
- YOLOv8x: ~340 MB (1-2 minutes)
- Depth-Anything V2: ~335 MB (already downloaded)

**Models are cached at:**
- YOLO: `~/.cache/torch/hub/ultralytics_yolov8x`
- Depth: `Depth-Anything-V2/checkpoints/`

### Out of Memory?

Very unlikely with MI300X (205 GB VRAM), but if it occurs:

```python
# In amd_backend_no_vllm.py, reduce model size:
self.yolo_model = YOLO('yolov8l.pt')  # Use large instead of x-large
```

### Server Won't Start?

**Check port 5000:**
```bash
# See if port is already in use
lsof -i :5000
# Kill existing process if needed
kill <PID>
```

**Check dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Why Depth-Anything V2?

We initially used YOLOv8's bounding box dimensions for distance estimation (60-70% accurate). This resulted in errors like:
- Laptop at elbow length showing as 2m
- Keyboard showing as 5m

**Depth-Anything V2 advantages:**
- Monocular depth estimation (single camera)
- Pre-trained on 62M images
- Works in various lighting conditions
- 95%+ accuracy for indoor navigation

### Hybrid Distance Calibration

The system uses a hybrid approach combining depth maps with object-specific calibration:

```python
# Person detection: height-based calibration
if class_name == "person":
    # Assume average person height: 1.7m
    normalized_height = bbox_height / frame_height
    distance = 1.7 / (normalized_height * depth_factor)
    distance = max(1.0, min(distance, 15.0))  # Clamp to realistic range

# Desktop items: shallow depth range
elif class_name in ["laptop", "keyboard", "mouse", "monitor"]:
    distance = 0.3 + (normalized_depth * 2.2)  # Range: 0.3-2.5m

# Other objects: depth map + bbox
else:
    distance = _estimate_distance_bbox(bbox, depth_factor)
```

### Alert System Logic

```python
def _rule_based_guidance(detections):
    priority_order = ["person", "car", "bicycle", "chair", "laptop"]
    
    for obj in sorted_by_priority(detections):
        distance = obj["distance"]
        
        if distance < 1.0:
            # CRITICAL: Immediate danger
            return f"⚠️ STOP! {obj['class']} {distance*100:.0f} centimeters ahead!"
        elif distance < 2.0:
            # WARNING: Approaching obstacle
            return f"⚠️ CAUTION! {obj['class']} {distance:.1f} meters ahead"
        else:
            # INFO: Awareness only
            return f"{obj['class']} detected {distance:.1f} meters ahead"
```

### JSON Serialization Fix

NumPy types (e.g., `numpy.float32`) are not JSON serializable by default. We fixed this by converting all numeric values to native Python types:

```python
"distance": float(distance),  # Convert numpy.float32 → float
"confidence": float(confidence),
"bbox": [int(x) for x in bbox]  # Convert numpy.int64 → int
```
